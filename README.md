### Hi, I'm Will 👋

I'm the **Product Manager** for [twinLab](https://twinlab.ai), a new AI tool for augmenting engineering workflows with Probabilistic ML (Bayesian Optimisation).

In my spare time, I'm concentrating on tooling and data engineering in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white); and building transaction systems and Spring Boot applications in Java.

- 🔭 I’m currently creating a portfolio backtesting tool to discourage myself from picking individual stocks...
- ❤️ I love good documentation - "If a tree falls in a forest..."
