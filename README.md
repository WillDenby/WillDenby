### Hi, I'm Will 👋

I'm the **Product Manager** for [twinLab](https://twinlab.ai), a new AI tool for augmenting engineering workflows with Probabilistic ML (Bayesian Optimisation).

In my spare time, I'm concentrating on:
1. Tooling and data engineering in Python
2. Building transaction systems and Spring Boot applications in Java
3. Completing some of John Crickett's [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro)
4. Making Open Source contributions to documentation: "If a tree falls in a forest"
