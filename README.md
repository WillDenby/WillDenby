### Hi, I'm Will üëã

I'm the **Product Manager** for [twinLab](https://twinlab.ai), a tool for augmenting engineering workflows with Probabilistic AI (Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimisation). This means helping engineers make better decisions, in shorter timeframes, without needing to collect as much expensive information. twinLab's real-time emulators (of simulations, experiments, or sensor networks) are particularly powerful with sparse / uncertain data. 

In my spare time, I enjoy:
1. Building Python Tooling
2. Learning Java
3. Completing John Crickett's [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro).
